VoyageStation is a container that may or may not have name and value attributes. It has a minimum height of 400px. The ultimate goal of using VoyageStation is as a sub-element of Voyager component to differentiate between navigable sections that could be navigated through using back/next buttons. 
```jsx
<VoyageStation name="Station 1" value="s1">
	<h1>Station 1</h1>
</VoyageStation>
```
